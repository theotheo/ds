"The science of dealing with data, once they have been established, while the relation of the data to what they represent is delegated to other fields and sciences.
"
-- Concise Survey of Computer Methods, Peter Naur

## 1977 Exploratory Data Analysis
Еще одна статья Tukey 
"arguing the importance of using data in selecting “which” hypotheses to test, and that confirmatory data analysis and exploratory data analysis should work hand-in-hand."

## 1993 Greater or lesser statistics: A choice for future research
- John Chambers, Bell Labs
- создатель языка S 
- Greater statistics: “Everything related to learning from data, from the first planning or collection to the last presentation or report”
- Lesser statistics: “The body of specifically statistical methodology that has evolved within the profession—roughly, statistics as defined by texts, journals, and doctoral dissertations”
- “If statisticians remain aloof, others will act. Statistics will lose.”

## 1993 R
- Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand

## 1994 обложка в Business Week
"Business Week ran the cover story, Database Marketing, revealing the ominous news companies had started gathering large amounts of personal information, with plans to start strange new marketing campaigns.
